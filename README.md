The Locomotion Project developed a profiler which detects parallel loops dynamically at runtime. This profiler will uses the Graal compiler infrastructure in order to register every read and write operation to/from memory and identifying potential dependancies.

The [dissertation PDF](http://chrisatk.in/pub/parallelism-detection.pdf) is available.
