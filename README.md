The Locomotion Project developed a profiler which detects parallel loops dynamically at runtime. This profiler will uses the Graal compiler infrastructure in order to register every read and write operation to/from memory and identifying potential dependancies.

The [dissertation PDF](http://chrisatk.in/pub/parallelism-detection.pdf) is available.

## Requirements

* Java 7+
* Lots of memory
* Graal in your classpath
